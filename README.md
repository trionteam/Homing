# Homing

Avoid homing missiles... on your way home.

An infinite runner game that we created during the [Global Game Jam
2019](https://globalgamejam.org/).

# How to play

You can play the game on-line in your browser on
[itch.io](https://trionteam.itch.io/homing). We recommend using a controller,
but you can also control the main character with WSAD and arrow keys. The Esc
key quits the game.

# Development

You will need a recent version of Unity to build the game, otherwise everything
is in the repository. The game should also build on Windows, Linux and Mac.
